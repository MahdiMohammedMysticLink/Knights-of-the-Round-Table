to build the project, open this repository inside of java eclipse.
Then, click file->export as runnable jar. The jar file must be placed in a directory
that has the /src/resources/newCards directory with all of the card images, as well
as the two stylesheets stylesheet.css, stylesheet2.css, and the font DUKEPLUSS.TTF
as well as the two jpg background images, drawn-wallpaper-cloud-2.jpg, and
Medieval-Wallpaper-HD.jpg. Optionally, just place the jar inside of 
Team50COMP3004Winter2018\Java\Maven. There should already be a jar(s) there that
you can run. To play the game, read the readme.txt file located in the same directory
as this file.

****make sure that the jar file is running in a directory where the full file path to it 
has no spaces! this is currently a bug in Java 8, where the css files won't load!!!!!!!**********
